## 5. Growth Investment Cases

### Platform Investments → Revenue Multipliers
| Initiative | Investment | Revenue Impact | ROI Timeline | Risk Level |
|------------|------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| **API Platform** | $2M (12 eng-months) | +$10M ARR (new integrations) | 18 months | Medium |
| **ML Personalization** | $1.5M (8 eng-months) | +15% conversion (+$5M ARR) | 12 months | Low |
| **Multi-tenant SaaS** | $3M (18 eng-months) | +$15M TAM (enterprise) | 24 months | High |
| **Mobile Platform** | $2.5M (15 eng-months) | +25% DAU (+$8M ARR) | 15 months | Medium |

### Technical Debt → Business Impact
| Debt Category | Current Cost | Remediation Cost | Business Benefit |
|---------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Legacy Architecture | $300K/month (velocity) | $2M (6 months) | +40% feature velocity |
| Security Updates | $150K/month (compliance) | $500K (3 months) | Reduced audit/cert costs |
| Performance Issues | $100K/month (churn) | $800K (4 months) | -5% customer churn |
| Monitoring Gaps | $200K/month (incidents) | $400K (2 months) | 75% faster resolution |

## 6. Risk → Revenue Analysis

### Business Continuity Matrix
| Risk Scenario | Probability | Revenue at Risk | Mitigation Cost | Decision |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Major Outage (4+ hours)** | 5%/year | $2M/incident | $500K (redundancy) | ✅ Invest |
| **Data Breach** | 2%/year | $10M (reputation) | $1M (security) | ✅ Invest |
| **Scaling Failure** | 15%/year | $5M (growth cap) | $3M (architecture) | ✅ Urgent |
| **Key Person Risk** | 20%/year | $1M (knowledge) | $200K (documentation) | ✅ Planned |

### Competitive Technology Risk
- **Platform Performance**: 100ms latency = 7% conversion loss
- **Feature Parity**: 6-month delay = 15% market share risk
- **Security Posture**: Breach = 25% customer churn + $5M penalties
- **Scalability Limits**: Growth ceiling = $20M ARR opportunity cost
